# Progress this past week: 
- Removed footer
- Added health score and 'ready in' details on the recipe page
- Removed a lot of pages
- Looked into APIs with a tutor
    - Hooked into a search API endpoint to search recipes by ingredients
    - Displayed search results into the page
    - Hooked into a recipe details API endpoint to show a specific recipe
    - Highlighted search terms in ingredients list

# Blockers
- Inconsistant data in API responses (some recipes don't have data for cooking time, prep time etc.)

# What you plan to work on next
- Review API details to see if there's anything more that can be done
